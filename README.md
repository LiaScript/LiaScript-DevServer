# LiaScript-DevServer

This project is intended to support the development of interactive courses with
[LiaScript](https://LiaScript.github.io). This projects implements a development
server that can be used locally to preview courses within the browser.

## Install

You can directly download the latest version for your system from the assets:

https://github.com/LiaScript/LiaScript-DevServer/releases/

or install it via the NodeJS package manager `npm` ...

### NodeJS

If you haven't installed it yet, you will have to install NodeJS for your
system. This is the actual runtime environment for your local server and also
contains the package manager that we will need for installing the
[LiaScript-DevServer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@liascript/devserver).

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

### LiaScript-DevServer

Open the terminal on your system and type the following command.

```bash
npm install -g @liascript/devserver
```

This will automatically install all dependencies and the devServer as well ...

> **Note:** On Windows you open a terminal by typing `cmd` into the program
> search or you can also use the Powershell.

## Usage

You can run the devServer by typing `liascript-devserver` or the short-cut
`liadev` into your terminal. The following command will print out some help
information on command-line parameters that you can use:

```bash
liascript-devserver --help
```

```text
 _     _       ____            _       _
| |   (_) __ _/ ___|  ___ _ __(_)_ __ | |_
| |   | |/ _` \___ \ / __| '__| | '_ \| __|
| |___| | (_| |___) | (__| |  | | |_) | |_
|_____|_|\__,_|____/ \___|_|  |_| .__/ \__|
                                |_|

-h  --help       show this help
-v  --version    show version information
-i  --input      input README.md file or folder (default: .)
-p  --port       used port number (default: 3000)
-l  --live       do live reload on file change
-o  --open       open in default browser
-t  --test       test online on https://LiaScript.github.io

-r  --responsiveVoice  add optional responsiveVoice support,
                       or pass your own responsiveVoice key.
                       Adding this feature might slow down
                       the reloading speed.
                       For more information visit:
```

> **Note:** `-h` or `--help` will only print out the help, all other parameters
> are ignored.

### `--version`

Use this to identify the current version, but you can alternatively also use the
shortcut `-v`:

```bash
liascript-devserver --version
```

At the moment this should give the following results. Since LiaScript gets
updated separately, we use two different version, one for the devServer and one
for LiaScript.

```text
DevServer: 1.1.38
LiaScript: 0.16.14
```

### `--input`

If you run the command `liascript-devserver` without any commands, the server
will run from your current directory and give you the following output.

```text
$ liascript-devserver

 _     _       ____            _       _
| |   (_) __ _/ ___|  ___ _ __(_)_ __ | |_
| |   | |/ _  \___ \ / __| '__| | '_ \| __|
| |___| | (_| |___) | (__| |  | | |_) | |_
|_____|_|\__,_|____/ \___|_|  |_| .__/ \__|
                                |_|

ðŸ“¡ starting server
   - local:           http://localhost:3000
   - on your network: http://192.168.2.114:3000
âœ¨ hit Ctrl-c to close the server
```

The server starts locally on port 3000, thus, if you open your browser and type
in the URL http://localhost:3000 you should see a similar image

However, if you add the `--input` parameter (shortcut `-i`) and pass it another
folder, this will be used as the root folder for the subsequent navigation.

```bash
liascript-devserver --input ../LiaBooks
```

But you can also refer to a specific Markdown file, in this case, the course
will be rendered immediately by the LiaScript interpreter, if you open the
following link in your browser.

```bash
liascript-devserver --input ../LiaBooks/docs/README.md

...
ðŸ“¡ starting server
   - local:           http://localhost:3000/liascript/index.html?http://localhost:3000/README.md
   - on your network: http://192.168.2.114:3000/liascript/index.html?http://192.168.2.114:3000/README.md
âœ¨ hit Ctrl-c to close the server
```

### `--open`

**If you want to open the preview immediately, then use this parameter.** It
will open your default browser with the displayed URL automatically.

```bash
liascript-devserver --open -i ../LiaBooks
```

### `--live`

Use this parameter if you want to have live updates. The server will monitor
file changes within the defined folder. When you type and save your document, a
reload will be automatically triggered. If you prefer to reload your changes
manually via pressing `F5` do not use this option.

```bash
liascript-devserver --live -o -i ../LiaBooks/docs/README.md
```

### `--port`

It is only possible to run on devServer at a given port-number, thereby 3000 is
used as the default value. If you want to start multiple servers on different
folders or the port-number is already occupied by another process or server,
this will will be shown by the following error message:

```bash
liascript-devserver -o -i ../LiaBooks

...
ðŸ“¡ starting server
   - local:           http://localhost:3000/liascript/index.html?http://localhost:3000/README.md
   - on your network: http://192.168.2.114:3000/liascript/index.html?http://192.168.2.114:3000/README.md
âœ¨ hit Ctrl-c to close the server
ðŸš¨ error => listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000
```

However, by using `--port 3001` or `-p 3001` you can redefine this number and
run different servers separately:

```bash
liascript-devserver --port 3001 -o -i ../LiaBooks

...
ðŸ“¡ starting server
   - local:           http://localhost:3001/liascript/index.html?http://localhost:3001/README.md
   - on your network: http://192.168.2.114:3001/liascript/index.html?http://192.168.2.114:3001/README.md
âœ¨ hit Ctrl-c to close the server
```

### `--test`

Since we are using a local devServer, it is also possible to test your courses
online on the LiaScript project website: https://LiaScript.github.io

See how the URL changes by setting the parameter `--test`:

```bash
liascript-devserver --test -o -i ../LiaBooks/docs/README.md

...
ðŸ“¡ starting server
   - local:           https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?http://localhost:3000/README.md
   - on your network: https://LiaScript.github.io/course/?http://192.168.2.114:3000/README.md
âœ¨ hit Ctrl-c to close the server
```

> **Note:** Live reload with `--live` will not work in this mode, since the
> server is only used to serve local data and not the LiaScript website.
> Additionally you will have to remove the courses manually from the index.

### `--responsiveVoice`

Automated Text2Speech is **Not** enabled by default, since it reduces the reload
speed. But you can add this support by add this parameter, in this case the
LiaScript project key is automatically injected. However, you can also pass your
own key from your own project/website like this:

```bash
$ liascript-devserver --responsiveVoice YOURKEY -i ../LiaBooks
```
